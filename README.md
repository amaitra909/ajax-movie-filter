# AJAX Movie Filter
This sprint is for learning AJAX.


## Steps
1. This is a project that has a Node.JS server. This means that you need to have `node` installed.
2. To start, first clone this project then run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000`
4. Open up `index.html` and `main.js`. Use jQuery (with `$.ajax()`) to complete the movie search app. Remember to use Slack for assistance!
